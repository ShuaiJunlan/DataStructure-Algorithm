## DataStructure-Algorithm

In order to enhance my designing capability of normal algorithm, I make a plan, exercising algorithm everyday. So this repository is used for storing algorithm programs, which include ___LeetCode___ algorithms and ___Sword Offer___ algorithms, and using three kinds of program language(Java/C/C++) to achieve it. Ok, you can visit my [leetcode home page](https://leetcode.com/shuaijunlan/ "leetcode home page") for further details.
